        <p id="quote" class="quote">I understand your distaste for me: It's logical, inevitable, for you have seen me relentless to hurt you, but you never looked any deeper. I admit that i did all I could to provoke in you a fury of revulsion for me. I drove you away from wherever i wanted, public or private. I set a whole ocean between us. I even made a law that your name should never be taken in my presence. And if the measured penalty for all this is desolation, I seek to accept it. If your hatred answer my hatred,  and nothing but my hatred,  then let the way of hatred remain paved. Let there be a lore of hatred✨</p>
